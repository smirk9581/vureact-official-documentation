# Conventions of This Tutorial

- All sample codes in the document only show important code or pseudocode to highlight key points.

- All displayed Demo examples are stored on the [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/intelligent-dawn-w4c2h5) website, which contains all complete code implementations. Alternatively, you can view the corresponding source code through the `Open SandBox` button of the Demo.

- All examples and codes are aligned with the official documentation of [Vue3 built-in components](http://vcn.vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/transition.html) and [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/zh/introduction.html), achieving almost complete consistency.

- We assume that you already have a certain understanding of **React**, **Vue**, **React Router DOM**, and **Vue Router**.
