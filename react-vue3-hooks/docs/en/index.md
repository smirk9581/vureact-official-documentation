    title: Intelligent Reactive State (Vue Style)
    details: Unify Vue's ref and reactive mental models. Complex objects support Draft-style direct modification, eliminating the need for manual immutable data management and greatly simplifying state logic.

  - icon: 🎯
    title: Precise Side Effect Monitoring (Vue Watch)
    details: Fully implement the watch API, supporting multiple data sources, deep monitoring, immediate execution, and on-demand stopping. Achieve clearer and more granular side effect control than the native useEffect.

    title: Semantic Lifecycle Management
    details: Replace the complex useEffect dependency array pattern with dedicated Hooks like useMounted, useUpdated, and useUnmounted, making component lifecycle logic clearer and easier to maintain.
